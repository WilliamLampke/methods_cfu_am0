# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase
''' lowers H and W '''
# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")
''' testing if the string "hello" is in "Hello World" returns true '''

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
''' Checks if the string "Hello World" ends with "Hello" and returns false '''

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")
''' Checks if the string "Hello World" ends with "rld" and returns true '''

12.even?
''' checks if the int 12 is even and returns true '''

18.next
''' prints the int after the int 18, returns 19 '''
