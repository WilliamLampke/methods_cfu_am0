# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
''' Very, although theres always more you can learn! '''
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
''' Very '''
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
''' Not really a question, but just curious how complicated they can get (which im sure the answer is very complicated). '''
